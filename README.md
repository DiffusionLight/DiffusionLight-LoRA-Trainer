### Getting started

```shell
bash final_train_cont_largeT@900.sh
```

wait over a night on Single RTX 3090 until it create folder `ThisIsTheFinal-lora-hdr-continuous-largeT@900/0_-5/checkpoint-2500` which we provide in main repository


### Dataset 

We use the [Text2Light](https://frozenburning.github.io/projects/text2light/) to generate HDR Environment map using the prompt which also generated by ChatGPT-3.5. 

However, you can download a pre-generated dataset at [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/DiffusionLight/text2dataset) or [OneDrive (133 GB)](https://vistec-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/pakkapon_p_s19_vistec_ac_th/Es_xIFk67UBPkVdW25cwDScBdvNlsZYz8lZblO7ZGzqGNg?e=q1dUqd) which contain 1412 images pair of Low-FOV LDR and HDR Environment map

To download the dataset from Huggingface, simply use git clone (please make sure that you have git lfs enabled)
```
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/DiffusionLight/text2dataset
```
